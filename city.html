                        <h2>Ankara</h2>
                        <p class="lead">Ankara is the capital city of Turkey and the second largest city in the country after Istanbul. It is located at the heart of both Turkey and Central Anatolia.</p>
                        <p class="mb-0">Ankara sometimes gets left off people's travel itineraries, which is a shame because Turkey's capital has more to offer than most visitors realize. If one of your prime travel goals is to discover the vast breadth of Turkey's history, Ankara is a great place to visit. 
<br>
<br>
                        Both the country's top museum and Atatürk's mausoleum, two of the country's most important historic tourist attractions, are found here, plus a sightseeing stroll around Ankara's citadel district offers a glimpse of the city's past, before it was promoted to capital status.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h3> Things to do in Ankara: </h3>
                        <p class="mb-0">
                                <h4> 1. Visit Anitkabir (Atatürk Mausoleum)</h4>
                                 <p> Ankara's most visited attraction is also Turkey's most important modern pilgrimage site. Sitting on a hilltop, just to the west of the city center, is the mausoleum of Atatürk (Mustafa Kemal), the founder of the state of Turkey.</p>
                                <p> Address: Yücetepe, 31 Akdeniz Caddesi, Çankaya, Ankara</p>
                                <h4> 2. Walk the Citadel Neighbourhood</h4>
                                 <p>A wander through this neighborhood is one of the most atmospheric things to do in Ankara. The citadel (Kale) area dates from the Byzantine era and is ringed by, still immense in places, fortifications raised in the 9th century.</p>
                            
                                <p>The main attraction inside the inner walls is the Eastern Tower (Sark Kulesi), which offers vistas that span across modern Ankara from its crenellated ramparts.</p>
                                
                                <p>Address: Gözcü Sokak, Kale, Altindag, Ankara</p>
                                <h4> 3. Shop for Local Crafts in the Hamamönü Neighborhood</h4>
                                 <p>This small area of traditional, wooden-beamed Ottoman-period mansions in central Ankara has been fully restored and has become a popular weekend destination for café life and arts and crafts.</p>
                                 
                                <p>Hamamönü is one of the few areas in the central city that has managed to preserve its architecture, so a stroll here is a taster of what the city looked like before the modern era.</p>
                              
                              <p> Address: Talatpasa Bulvari 126, Hacettepe, Ankara</p>

                        <h2>Istanbul</h2>
                        <p class="lead">Istanbul has a timeless charm that owes much to its rich history. The city was historically referred to as Byzantium and Constantinople. It served as a focal point of several ancient empires.</p>
                        <p class="mb-0">Numerous architectural wonders, remnants of these empires, still stand tall in the heart of the city. These include the Hagia Sophia, which stood the tests of time and continues to invite awe with its display of dazzling mosaics. 
<br>
<br>
                        Besides Istanbul’s historical sites, you can find modern skyscrapers and malls. There are cool spots in and around the city to escape to, some of which offer breathtaking views over the city and the Bosporus Strait. Read on for more ideas on things to do in Istanbul, to help you discover the best of this alluring Turkish city and cultural melting pot. </p>
                        <br>
                        <h3> Things to do in Istanbul: </h3>
                        <p class="mb-0">
                                <h4> 1. Visit The Blue Mosque</h4>
                                <p> A magnificent historical sight also known as the Sultan Ahmet Mosque.
                                <br>
                                The Blue Mosque is an iconic historical landmark in Istanbul and one you shouldn’t miss. Once inside, you’ll discover where the mosque got its name – from the thousands of blue handcrafted İznik tiles that adorn the interior walls. The tiles depict traditional Ottoman patterns, flowers, fruit, and more. You can also see the mausoleum of Sultan Ahmed I, 6 elegant minarets, and the impressive 43-metre central dome.
                                <br>
                                As a fully functional religious building, it’s important to respect the rules and not make too much noise. Men and women need to cover their knees, shoulders and upper arms; women must also cover their hair. Unless you want to pray, plan your visit outside of the 5 daily prayer times. Entrance is free, but donations are welcomed. 
                                 </p>
                                <p>Address: Sultan Ahmet, Atmeydanı Cd. No:7, 34122 Fatih, Istanbul</p>
                                <h4> 2. Learn History in Topkapı Palace</h4>
                                <p> Topkapı Palace and Harem are likely to have more colourful stories than most of the world's museums put together. Libidinous sultans, ambitious courtiers, beautiful concubines and scheming eunuchs lived and worked here between the 15th and 19th centuries when it was the court of the Ottoman empire. A visit to the palace's opulent pavilions, jewel-filled Treasury and sprawling Harem gives a fascinating glimpse into their lives.</p>
                                <p>Address: Cankurtaran, 34122 Fatih/Istanbul </p>
                                <h4> 3. Shop in the Grand Bazaar</h4>
                                <p> Istanbul borders the narrow Bosporus Strait where the waters of the Black Sea meet the inland Sea of Marmara. It was historically a main point of arrival for trade ships. 
                                </p>
                                <p> You can wander the cramped alleys of the covered Grand Bazaar to see the city’s colourful commercial activities alive and kicking. This huge market comprises a network of indoor souks (smaller marketplaces) and lanes lined with peddlers. They sell everything from carpets and leather items to jewellery and trinkets, including the typically sought-after nazar evil eye ornaments.</p>
                                <p> Address:  Beyazıt Mh., 34126 Fatih/Istanbul</p>
